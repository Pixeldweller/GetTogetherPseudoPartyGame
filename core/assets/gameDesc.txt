Weird Pong#Just as you might know...; Pong is a traditional 2D retro game based on moving paddles to basically hit a ball back and forth; You will be split into two teams and you compete against each other!; Other than in the original game, you will have to share the pitch with your teammates; and you will have to pay attention to new pick ups, that can upgrade your paddle or make things just worse...;...and they might eventually  kill you..; ..and..; you can even sabotage your teammates if you want a solo win! Good luck!

Weird PongExtra#Oh, seems like we have an uneven ammount of players...;@player, I asign you a special role...;Your special task is to kill an entire team on either side; ...by converting the balls into a deathly ones by touching them with your paddle!;If one team dies, you automatically win, alone. Get Ready......; GO!
